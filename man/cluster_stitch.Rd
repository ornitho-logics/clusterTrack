\title{Stitch clusters by spatial overlap across segments}
\usage{
cluster_stitch(ctdf, overlap_threshold = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{ctdf}{A CTDF object. Must contain an updated `cluster` column.}

\item{overlap_threshold}{Numeric between 0 and 1; minimum area‐overlap ratio
                         required to merge adjacent clusters.
                         Clusters with overlap > threshold are combined.
#' @return The input CTDF, with an updated (in-place) cluster` column.}
}
\description{
Iteratively merge spatial clusters in a CTDF based on the area overlap of
their convex hulls. Clusters whose hulls overlap above a specified ratio
are combined into a single cluster ID.

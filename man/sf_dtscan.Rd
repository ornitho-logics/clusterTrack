\title{DTSCAN: Delaunay Triangulation-Based Spatial Clustering.}
\usage{
sf_dtscan(x, min_pts = 5, area_z_min = -1, length_z_min = -1, id_col = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{sf} object with POINT geometry.}

\item{min_pts}{Minimum neighbour count for a point to be treated as a core point.
Neighbours are the sites directly connected by kept Delaunay edges after pruning.
If multiple input points share exactly the same coordinates, they are collapsed to one site and
their multiplicity contributes to this count.}

\item{area_z_min}{Threshold (in SD units) on the inverse z-score of triangle areas used for pruning.
Larger thresholds keep only progressively smaller-than-average triangles and prune more edges. Default to 0.}

\item{length_z_min}{Threshold (in SD units) on the inverse z-score of Delaunay edge lengths used for pruning.
Larger thresholds keep only progressively shorter-than-average edges and prune more connections.}

\item{id_col}{Optional character scalar naming a unique identifier column in \code{x} used to align output.
If \code{NULL} or missing from \code{x}, output is aligned by current row order.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of cluster labels of length \code{nrow(x)}.
\code{0} indicates noise/unassigned; positive integers are cluster ids.
}
\description{
Runs a clustering using a Delaunay triangulation of point coordinates.
}
\details{
Identical coordinates are collapsed before triangulation; their multiplicity contributes
to MinPts via \code{effective_degree = degree + (mult - 1)}.
Cluster labels are produced by starting a new cluster at each unassigned core site
(a site meeting the MinPts rule) and iteratively visiting all sites reachable through
pruned Delaunay edges from that seed; the cluster id is assigned to every visited site.

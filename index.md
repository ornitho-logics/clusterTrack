**Identification of use-sites from animal movement tracks using
spatiotemporal segmentation and adjacency-based spatial clustering**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**clusterTrack** provides a clustering-based framework for identifying
recurring use-sites in animal movement tracks with complex
spatiotemporal structure. It is designed for data with irregular
sampling, noise, long temporal gaps, and fragmented revisitation
patterns, where movement models and purely spatial clustering often
perform poorly.
